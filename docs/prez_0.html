# Introduction

This lesson will only cover
[front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) development
with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Lesson 2 will cover full-stack development
using the same approach with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and
[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/). Lesson 3 will focus on
[web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) and
[DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) with
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

class: center, middle, main-title

# 1: Setup a dev environment
Some of the following setup isn’t strictly necessary to complete this lesson,
but will be necessary for future lessons and will prepare your system for future
development.


---
## 1.1: Required software
While there are [alternatives to Git](https://stackoverflow.com/q/995636), they
are not as common these days. You should learn Git. To a lesser but still
notable degree, [Node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) is popular in the web dev sphere. For this lesson, both are
required.


---
### 1.1.1: Install Git
Download installer [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Yours is likely a
64-bit system. Use defaults but, if you’re on Windows, make sure to choose &quot;use
git and optional unix tools.&quot;

![site result example](image_111.png)

If you forget the step above, you will later receive a &quot;command not found&quot;
message. To fix,
[open your terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/)
and run `SETX PATH &quot;%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin&quot;` to update your PATH
variable, or
[edit it in system settings](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).

To confirm Git installed successfully, open your terminal, type `git --version`
and press enter. A number should display.


---
### 1.1.2: Install NodeJS
Download installer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). The update PATH option should
be checked by default, but if for some reason it doesn&#39;t update you can use
where node to get Node’s path on disk and `SETX PATH` like above, or just run
the installer again with the box checked.

ℹ️Note: if you’re on a Unix (Mac or Linux) system, using
[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) instead of the
default installer is highly recommended.

To confirm Node installed successfully, open your terminal, type
`node --version` and press enter. A number should display.


---
class: center, middle, title

## 1.2: Optional software

---
### 1.2.1: Pick a terminal emulator
You can always use the stock terminal/command-prompt, and some are decent like
Powershell (Windows) and Gnome terminal (most Linux distros), but most
developers end up using alternatives for the extra features and customizability.

Popular options:


- Windows: [Cmder](https://cmder.net/)
- Mac: [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)
- Linux: [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix)

ℹ️Note: Microsoft
[just announced](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527870/microsoft-windows-terminal-command-line-tool)
a better stock terminal for Windows 10 which might be out soon, so that might be
worth a look. Also, for further terminal customization in *nix environments, I
recommend
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).


---
### 1.2.2: Pick an editor
There’s a lot of options here, including just a stock text editor, however I
recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a popular and
relatively beginner-friendly option that will familiarize you with
[IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

For this lesson you don’t need any extensions, and you can explore the
[extension market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) at your leisure,
but I recommend finding yourself a linter (like
[TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin))
or
[ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
and a code formatter (like
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)).

If you’d like to try something different,
[here are some other common editors](https://designrevision.com/best-code-editor/).
ℹ️Note: if you go with [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), be prepared for a steep
learning curve. [This game](https://vim-adventures.com/) is a fun way to start
learning.


---
### 1.2.3: Pick a package manager
Basically this is either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). In this lesson I’ll use Yarn but you’ll see NPM
used in other tutorials. To install yarn, just `npm i -g yarn`.

If you want to use npm just use npm in place of yarn in any of the commands
below.

You’ll also see the use of npx below, which isn’t a typo. It’s a special npm
command for temporarily installing and eXecuting libraries you intend to only
use once.


---
## 1.3: Version control
This makes it much easier to manage changes in your project, especially with
multiple developers involved. Think of it like a thumbdrive that remembers
exactly how its files have been changed over time. Even for small projects like
the one in this lesson, Version Control is always recommended for project source
code.

The SSH setup below is not strictly required, since you could use the HTTPS
protocol and authenticate in the terminal, however you’ll later need SSH for a
variety of other tasks, and employers will expect you’re familiar with it.


---
### 1.3.1: Create a Github account
Simple enough: go to the [join page](https://github.com/join) and follow the
instructions, but a quick note regarding username choice:

Some people argue it’s better to use your real name as your username if you
intend to use it as part of your portfolio, sort of like using your name in the
email address you put on your resume instead of your old AIM handle. I never
gave it much thought, personally, but later in this lesson we will host your
site for free at *username.github.io* so bear that in mind when choosing your
username.


---
### 1.3.2: Create an SSH key
The steps for this vary depending on your operating system.


- Windows: Use
[PUTTY](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows),
[OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse),
or [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Mac and Linux: use
[ssh-keygen ](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-mac-os-x)

Without going into
[further detail re: SSH](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work),
just know that it’s a way of protecting traffic between computers on the web,
and what the steps above do is create a public key and a private key. The
private key stays on your machine and shouldn’t be shared with anyone. The
public key is given to the service you want to communicate with.


---
### 1.3.3: Add your SSH key to Github
Follow
[these steps](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

# 2: Setup a project

---
## 2.1: Setup a boilerplate app
In this section we will generate a
[boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) React app.
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a framework created by Facebook that’s fairly
popular right now.

There will likely be some new, trendy framework in a few years, but the
principles and patterns of
[MV*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
architecture,
[statefulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)&gt;), and
[componentization](http://blogs.windriver.com/koning/2006/09/components.html)
aren’t going anywhere and are transferable concepts.


---
### 2.1.1: Create React app
[Create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a project
boilerplate generator which abstracts out a lot of typical project complexity.
In our next lesson we will see what a more DIY approach looks like.

Navigate to your project directory using cd (e.g. `cd ~/projects`). If this is
your first project, you can `mkdir project`s and `cd projects`.

Run `npx create-react-app username.github.io --typescript` where &quot;username&quot; is
your GitHub username.

Once complete, navigate into this directory (e.g. `cd my-app`) and `git log` to
see that a git repo was initialized by CRA on your behalf. To escape the log
view, press `Q`.

To view the boilerplate app in its current state, run yarn start and the app
should serve up locally and open in your browser.


---
### 2.1.2: Add project to Github
This step ensures your code changes are backed up.

Follow the steps on
[this page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository) to
create a remote repo on Github and make sure to not check the box to initialize
the repo (if you accidentally initialize, it’s easy to
[delete](https://help.github.com/en/articles/deleting-a-repository) and recreate
the repo).

Next, [add the remote](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-remote) URL
to your local repo by running
`git remote add origin git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git` where
&quot;username&quot; is your username.

Finally, push your local repo to Github with
`git push --set-upstream origin master`. If you refresh your repo page, you
should now see your latest files and commits.

## 2.2: Configure deployment

---
### 2.2.1: Prepare for deployment to Github Pages
Install the [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) library with yarn
add gh-pages.

Open *package.json* which is at the root of the project and add the property
&quot;homepage&quot; to point to a Github pages site like the following:

```JSON
{
  ...
  "homepage": "http://username.github.io"
  ...
}
```
If you visit this URL in the browser now, there won’t be anything to see.

Also, add two lines to &quot;scripts&quot;

```JSON
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "predeploy": "yarn run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
These lines define [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) aliases,
which help to simplify and organize commands and scripting in your project. For
example, the command `yarn run deploy` now executes the command
`gh-pages -d build`, however because &quot;predeploy&quot; is defined, it runs
`yarn run build` prior to deploying, which is the default build command for your
app. To summarize, now whenever you `yarn run deploy`, your app will build and
deploy to Github Pages.


---
## 2.3: Deploy the site to Github pages
So let’s try it. Execute yarn run deploy in your terminal. At this point, if you
go to the URL of the homepage you defined above, you should see the spinning
React logo.

This will be the command you use in the future to deploy updates to your site.
At this point, we should commit our changes with
`git commit -am &quot;Add deployment scripts&quot; &amp;&amp; git push`.

# 3: Develop the site

---
## 3.1: Choose a UI framework
UI frameworks are not a requirement for most projects, and sometimes they can
even get in the way, however many developers use them to enforce design
principles in an application and/or to rapidly prototype views.

A few popular UI frameworks right now are [Material](https://material-ui.com/)
(Google), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (Twitter), and
[Semantic](https://semantic-ui.com/) (non-profit). Each have their merits but
I’ll be using Semantic UI in this lesson.

To install, run `yarn add semantic-ui-react`, then just add the CSS link to the
head tag of your HTML (./public/index.html). Also, while you&#39;re there, you might
as well update the title tag to something relevant.

```HTML
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
  <!--
    manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
    user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
  -->
  <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
  <!--
    Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
    It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
    Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

    Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
    work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
    Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
  -->
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.4.2/dist/semantic.min.css"
  />
  <title>Your Name</title>
</head>
```

---
## 3.2: Make a homepage
Start by blasting the boilerplate CRA content in src/App.tsx:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">

    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
Replace it with a call to your homepage component. We’ll call it &quot;PageHome&quot; to
keep the component classification info at the front.

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import PageHome from './components/PageHome';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <PageHome />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
You should see an error in the terminal after saving, since the PageHome.tsx
file doesn’t exist. We’ll do that next. Create a new file at
src/components/PageHome.tsx and populate it with the following to start:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import './PageHome.css';

const PageHome: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="page-home">
      <div className="centering-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageHome;
```
This sets up a component consisting of just an outer page div and an inner
centering container div. The terminal will show an error until we add the CSS
file at `src/components/PageHome.css`, which can look like this:

```CSS
.page-home {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}

.centering-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  margin: auto;
  height: 30vh;
  width: 40vw;
}
```
At this point your homepage will render, however it will be completely blank!
Next, we’ll add some content to the homepage using Semantic components:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import { Header, Icon, Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import './PageHome.css';

const PageHome: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="page-home">
      <div className="centering-container">
        <Header as="h2" icon textAlign="center">
          <Icon name="user" circular />
          <Header.Content>Your Name</Header.Content>
        </Header>
        <Container>
          Hi, I'm so-and-so. I'm a student at Borough of Manhattan Community
          College and a web app developer.
        </Container>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageHome;
```
This should show up as a blank page with your image placeholder, your name, and
an introduction.

![Home page example](image_320.png)

Later we’ll customize this page with your profile picture and social media
buttons, but this is a start.


---
## 3.3: Add navigation
Technically you could create this site purely with
[React state hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html), however one
of the fundamental assumptions of web browsers is that the URL path corresponds
to the page the user is on.

For example, when you copy paste a URL into a text message, you probably expect
that whoever uses the link would see the same page you do.

To preserve this behavior in a modern
[Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application),
which as its name indicates does not consist of multiple pages with different
locations on the server, requires some form of routing emulation system.
[React router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is a popular library
which helps accomplish this.

To use React router we first install the dependency (and its typings file) with
yarn add react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom.

Next, we need to add the
[BrowserRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api)
[HoE](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) to the entry-point
file src/index.tsx:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import \* as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA

serviceWorker.unregister();
```
Next, we will need access to the router state from within the application, so
we’ll need to run App through react-router’s withRouter function.

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import './App.css';
import PageHome from './components/PageHome';

const App = withRouter(props => {
  const {
    location: { pathname }
  } = props;

  console.log(pathname);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={PageHome} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
});

export default App;
```
In your browser, if you
[open the console](https://www.wickedlysmart.com/hfjsconsole/) you’ll see your
current route being logged (right now it should be the default, &quot;/&quot;.

Next, we must add our first route to src/App.tsx:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import './App.css';
import PageHome from './components/PageHome';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={PageHome}/>
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
This will have no perceivable effect at the moment, since &quot;/&quot; was the default
route we were already on, but we’ll need to add more pages next, and that’s
where the additional routes come in.


---
## 3.4: Add a Navigation Menu
We’ll add a navbar to your app. These types of menus are ubiquitous and with
reason: in short, while it’s cool to experiment with new approaches to layouts
and UI concepts, generally good UIs are intuitive, which means predictable, and
the easiest way to make something predictable is to do things the way users are
already familiar with.

First, create a new root level SUI element in src/App.tsx called Menu:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route, Link, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import './App.css';
import PageHome from './components/PageHome';
import { Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const App = withRouter(props => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Menu fixed={'top'} pointing={true} secondary={true}>
      </Menu>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={PageHome} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
});

export default App;
```
This will appear as an empty navigation bar. We’ll need to add a menu item that
corresponds to the home page route:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route, Link, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import './App.css';
import PageHome from './components/PageHome';
import { Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const App = withRouter(props => {
  const {
    location: { pathname }
  } = props;

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Menu fixed={'top'} pointing={true} secondary={true}>
        <Menu.Item
          active={pathname === '/'}
          name="Home"
          icon="home"
          as={Link}
          to="/"
        />
      </Menu>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={PageHome} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
});

export default App;
```
At this point, you should see the rendered navigation bar with a new home page
button:

![Navigation bar example](image_340.png)

Nice, we now have a menu, though it’s kind of sparse. Let’s add a few more
pages.


---
## 3.5: Add a Resume page
We’ll start with a resume page. There are many ways you can do this, including
using resume HTML templates which you can copy-paste into your react component,
however I will give an example of a basic resume layout using Semantic UI.

First, create a new component at src/components/PageResume.tsx:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import { Header, Content } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const PageResume: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="page-resume">
      <Header>Your Name</Header>
      <Content>
        Stuff about me
      </Content>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageResume;
```
Before continuing, let’s add the route we need to access this new page. In
src/App.tsx, add an additional Route and MenuItem corresponding to our new page:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route, Link, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import './App.css';
import PageHome from './components/PageHome';
import PageResume from './components/PageResume';

const App = withRouter(props => {
  const {
    location: { pathname }
  } = props;

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Menu fixed={'top'} pointing={true} secondary={true}>
        <Menu.Item
          active={pathname === '/'}
          name="Home"
          icon="home"
          as={Link}
          to="/"
        />
        <Menu.Item
          active={pathname === '/about'}
          name="About Me"
          as={Link}
          to="/about"
        />
      </Menu>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={PageHome} />
        <Route exact path="/about" component={PageResume} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
});

export default App;
```
At this point, our menu should start looking more like a menu:

![Example navigation menu with additional options](image_350.png)

&quot;About&quot; is a common page on websites, and usually contains at least a paragraph
or two regarding the company, product, or individual. In this case, you could
just write a couple of paragraphs about yourself and call it a day. If you have
time, however, it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to fill this out as a complete,
printable resume. In this example, we&#39;ll create a page that&#39;s a full HTML-based
resume, in case that&#39;s something you&#39;re interested in.

We can use Semantic UI to map out the general structure of a typical resume:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import './PageResume.css';
import { Header, Container, Divider } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const PageResume: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="page-resume">
      <Header as="h2" textAlign={'center'}>
        Your Name
      </Header>
      <Container text textAlign={'left'}>
        <Header as="h3">Education</Header>
      </Container>
      <Divider hidden />
      <Container text>
        <Header as="h3">Skills</Header>
      </Container>
      <Divider hidden />
      <Container text>
        <Header as="h3">Experience</Header>
      </Container>
      <Divider hidden />
      <Container text>
        <Header as="h3">Projects</Header>
      </Container>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageResume;
```
This divides the page into a title header (your name) and 4 distinct sections
for education, skills, experience and projects. Resumes can be organized in a
lot of ways, of course, and this is just an example, but if you&#39;re applying to
your first developer job after school, odds are your actual relevant experience
is limited and you&#39;ll need to emphasize education and projects (personal,
research, etc).

We can also add an accompanying CSS file (src/components/PageResume.css) to
adjust the page position:

```CSS
.page-resume {
  margin-top: 50px;
  text-align: left;
}
```
We can fill out the content of each section with some basic HTML:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import './PageResume.css';
import { Header, Container, Divider } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const PageResume: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="page-resume">
      <Header as="h2" textAlign={'center'}>
        Your Name
      </Header>
      <Container text textAlign={'left'}>
        <Header as="h3">Education</Header>

export default PageResume;

We now have a content-filled web page that should double as a workable resume.

## 3.6: Add a Projects page
The projects page will be the entry-point for our project summaries.

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import './PageProjects.css';
import { Container, Card, Divider } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const PageProjects: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="page-projects">
      <Divider hidden />
      <Container>
      </Container>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageProjects;
```
There are a number of ways we could organize this page, but one popular UI
scheme is a [card system](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/).
Cards are good at chunking summary info in an interactive way:

```TSX
import React from 'react';
import './PageProjects.css';
import { Container, Card, Divider } from 'semantic-ui-react';

const PageProjects: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="page-projects">
      <Divider hidden />
      <Container>
        <Card.Group centered>
          <Card
            header="Project #1"
            meta="February 2019 - May 2019"
            description="Drone-based anti-mosquito air superiority"
            href={'https://github.com/username/repo-name'}
            image={
              'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/91gnkZGKGEY/maxresdefault.jpg'
            }
          />
          <Card
            header="Project #2"
            meta="August 2018 - January 2019"
            description="Climate crisis solved using legos"
            href={'https://github.com/username/repo-name'}
            image={
              'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lego-wind-turbines_landscape_high-e1501029441183.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=410&h=230.55432984004415'
            }
          />
          <Card
            header="Project #3"
            meta="March 2018 - July 2018"
            description="Super secret classified project (with pictures)"
            href={'https://github.com/username/repo-name'}
            image={
              'https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg'
            }
          />
        </Card.Group>
      </Container>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageProjects;
```
Which should result in a three-card projects group:

![Example of a card group for projects](image_360.png)

These cards can link directly to project pages, such as a github repo or a
publication, or we could add project details within popup
&quot;[modals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window)&quot; like this:

```TSX
import React, { Component, MouseEvent } from 'react';
import './PageProjects.css';
import {
  Container,
  Card,
  Divider,
  Modal,
  Header,
  Button,
  CardProps,
  Image
} from 'semantic-ui-react';

interface PageProjectsProps {
  // tslint:disable-line
}

interface PageProjectsState {
  activeModal: number;
}

class PageProjects extends Component<PageProjectsProps, PageProjectsState> {
  public constructor(props: PageProjectsProps, context: object) {
    super(props, context);

    this.state = {
      activeModal: -1
    };
  }

  protected handleModalClose = () => this.setState({ activeModal: -1 });

  protected handleModalOpen = (
    _: MouseEvent,
    { index: activeModal }: CardProps
  ) => this.setState({ activeModal });

  private get modals() {
    const modalConfigs = [
      [
        'sun',
        'Drone-based anti-mosquito air superiority',
        'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/91gnkZGKGEY/maxresdefault.jpg'
      ],
      [
        'superpowers',
        'Climate crisis solved using legos',
        'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lego-wind-turbines_landscape_high-e1501029441183.jpg'
      ],
      [
        'user secret',
        'Super secret classified project with pictures',
        'https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/secret_squirrel_1965_shush_3766.jpg'
      ]
    ];

    return modalConfigs.map(([icon, title, imgSrc], idx) => (
      <Modal
        key={`modal_${idx}`}
        open={this.state.activeModal === idx}
        onClose={this.handleModalClose}
        size="small"
      >
        <Header icon={icon} content={`Project #${idx + 1}`} />
        <Modal.Content>
          <h3>{title}</h3>
          <Image src={imgSrc} />
          <p>

        <Modal.Actions>
          <Button
            color="green"
            onClick={this.handleModalClose}
            icon="checkmark"
            content="Got it"
            inverted
          />
        </Modal.Actions>
      </Modal>
    ));
  }

  public render() {
    return (
      <div className="page-projects">
        <Divider hidden />
        <Container>
          <Card.Group centered>
            <Card
              header="Project #1"
              meta="February 2019 - May 2019"
              index={0}
              onClick={this.handleModalOpen}
              description="Drone-based anti-mosquito air superiority"
              image={
                'https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/gears-wheels-blades/512/gears-512.png'
              }
            />
            <Card
              header="Project #2"
              meta="August 2018 - January 2019"
              index={1}
              onClick={this.handleModalOpen}
              description="Climate crisis solved using legos"
              image={
                'https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/gears-wheels-blades/512/gears-512.png'
              }
            />
            <Card
              header="Project #3"
              meta="March 2018 - July 2018"
              index={2}
              onClick={this.handleModalOpen}
              description="Super secret classified project with pictures"
              image={
                'https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/gears-wheels-blades/512/gears-512.png'
              }
            />
          </Card.Group>
        </Container>
        {this.modals}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default PageProjects;
```
Which would show a modal dialog when the project cards are clicked:

# 4: Customize (guided experimentation)
Here are some exercises you can try on your own. Solution examples are in the
appendix.


---
## 4.1: How would you change the picture on the home page?
Right now, the image on the home page is a placeholder icon. You might consider
adding a picture of yourself there. How would you go about this?

Hints:


- It requires editing the PageHome.tsx file
- You will probably need to import a local image
- Alternatively, you could
[use an existing online pic](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/share-url-facebook-image-48893.html)

Bonus:


- You could use the Semantic UI
[Image](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/image/) component


---
## 4.2: Can we include social media buttons?
An easy way to connect with your audience is via social media, and since users
prefer to have everything at their fingertips, a common option for the
social-media-inclined is to add buttons that link directly to relevant social
media profiles. How would you go about this?

Hints:


- You&#39;ll be editing the PageHome.tsx file again
- You could use Semantic UI
[buttons](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/button/#variations-circular-social)

# Conclusion
In this lesson we built a simple website using React, a modern single-page web
application framework. A lot of web applications can be built this way.

Our next lesson will expand on what we learned here, covering full-stack
development with an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server and
[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for persisting data between sessions.

Lesson 3 will focus on [web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)
and [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) with
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). This will expand on the concepts we
learn in lesson 2 and highlight current methods for modularizing back-end
functionality.
